# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Overview

Alphabet Soup is looking to create a machine learning and neural network capable of predicting applicant success if funded by the company. With data on over 34,000 organization in years past, we will create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results

### Data Pre-Processing

### Optimitizations
 - Optimization 1: Increased the class_counts < value from 1800 to 2000 reducing the number of classification values from 6 to 4. With optimization, the Accuracy Score dropped from 0.7291 to 0.7268. Therefore the class_count will be reset back to 1800 before the next optimization
 - Optimization 2:
